# Guardian Discord bot

Bot functionalities include:
- Music playback
- Image storage and indexing

The problem which inspired image storage and indexing is quick identification and resending of an already sent meme; a short, humoristic expression of ideas and viewpoints of certain individuals/groups. 


In this simplified case it would be an image commonly consisting of text + some sort of image meme template.
